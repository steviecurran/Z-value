# Z-value
Python code for calculating Z-value from probability

Simple code which saves using those confusing Z-value tables at the back of your stats book.
Just enter the p-value (e.g. 0.05 for 95% likelihood).

Code will also produce plot, which can be disabled by commenting "plt.show()", although this makes an excellent teaching tool in numerical intergration. Just set npts = 100 for a demonstration.

C version also avaiable in more accuracy required at ridiculously high Z-values (>6Ïƒ, p < one in a billion).
