# Z-value
Calculate the significance (Z-score) from the p-value.

Simple code which saves using those confusing Z-score tables at the back of your stats book, which is likely only to go up to Z = 3.49, or a two-sided probability p > 0.000483 (calculated from this code).

If p is very small  and inf is returned, use the C version
